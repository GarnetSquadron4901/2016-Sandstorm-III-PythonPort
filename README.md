# 2016-Sandstorm-III-PythonPort
Here's the repo for our Python porting project to evaluate Python programming for FRC.

Here are a few things you'll need.

## 1. Install Python 3.5##
Install latest Python 3.5 release from here [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) to C:\Python35. Be sure to select the option to add Python to your PATH. 

If you did everything correctly, you should be able to install the Python requirements using PIP. 

## 2.  Install Python libraries##

Start Command Prompt and enter this command: 
> pip install pyfrc ipython pyreadline wheel

## 3. Install PyGame##
If you want to use a Joystick or Game Pad with the Python Simulation, you'll need to install another Python extension called PyGame. Depending on what version of Python you installed (32-bit or 64-bit), you'll either need to get the win32 for 32-bit or amd64 for 64-bit. You can download PyGame from here: [http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame)


To install it, open command prompt in the folder you downloaded PyGame to by Shift+Right Clicking in the folder and selecting Open Command Prompt. You should be able to type 
> pip install pygame-1.9.2b1-cp35-cp35m...

with the filename completed for the file you downloaded. 

##4. Install PyCharm Python IDE##
